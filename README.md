# ElysiaGame
Some records of a two-person project that I spent 2 years on.

### 3D Model Examples 
Contain some of the models I created for the game as .stl and .x3d files.

### Code Examples 
Contains some code that we wrote for the game. Note that this code will not work individually and is contained for the purpose of demonstrating my C# skills.

### Demo Builds
Contains some builds from different stages of the game. Note that there will be some bugs as the game was not at a complete state at the time of the build. 

### Recordings
Currently yet to upload recordings to this folder. Note that this folder will contain recordings of gameplay in the future.
